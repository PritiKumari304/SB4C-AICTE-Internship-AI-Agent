# 🧠 SB4C-AICTE-AI-Agent

This repository contains the project developed as part of the **Smart Bridge for Change (SB4C) AICTE Internship** program. The project focuses on building an **AI Agent** using modern AI frameworks and cloud deployment technologies. The agent is designed to simulate intelligent decision-making and can be integrated into various applications such as chatbots, recommendation systems, or automation tools.
